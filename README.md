# YARC - Yet Another RISC-V Chip
This is a project where I will implement a RISC-V SoC in [Chisel](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3).
This project is only meant to be the reflection of the history of my personal learning progress.
## Current State of Branches
* `bn-in-fn` 5-stage core with no branch instruction, no interlock (data dependency check), no data forwarding (bypassing).
